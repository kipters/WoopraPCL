# WoopraPCL
Portable .NET client for Woopra

This library relies on Dependency Injection for its dependencies, a sample implementation for the only dependency is provided for iOS and Android.
The repository contains a iOS sample app.

Coming soon:
1. Sample apps for Android, Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 10 (UWP)
2. MvvmCross-based sample app for all the platforms (maybe even WPF)
3. NuGet packages for the app and the service implementations

Known issues: it's currently impossibile to set an User-Agent header, without adding another service dependency; working on it.
